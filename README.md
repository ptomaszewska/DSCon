# Deep Spatial Context (DSCon)
The official implementation of the *DSCon* method which serves for the investigation of the attention-based vision models from the perspective of the concept of spatial context. The investigation is performed using the proposed three <ins>S</ins>patial <ins>C</ins>ontext <ins>M</ins>easures: *SCM<sub>features</sub>*, *SCM<sub>labels</sub>*, *SCM<sub>residuals</sub>*. \
The *DSCon* method was introduced in *`Deep spatial context: when attention-based models meet spatial regression'* by Paulina Tomaszewska, Elżbieta Sienkiewicz, Mai P. Hoang, Przemysław Biecek.

This repository is built on top of the repository (https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM) with the implementation of the CLAM model which served as a canvas for experiments with *DSCon* method.
